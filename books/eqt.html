                <strong>Abstract:</strong> Core Concepts and Fundamental Propositions of the "Energy Quanta Theory" (EQT)

The "Energy Quanta Theory" (EQT) advocates using "frequency" and "energy density" as the primary language to describe nature, rather than a priori establishing "particles" or "fields" as fundamental entities. Key concepts include:

Energy Quantum (Energon): Not simply a photon or a strictly defined gauge boson, but a more primordial concept of a "discrete unit of energy," emphasizing an existence "anchored by frequency." The energy of each energon is quantified by E = h\nu, and its frequency \nu determines its dynamics and coupling scale.
Mass Quantum (Masson): When energons become stationary ("reside") through non-linear feedback and phase-locking in a local region, they manifest as "inertia" and "rest mass." The masson is thus viewed as a frequency-condensed stable state. The magnitude of mass can be understood as the local accumulation of the energy density corresponding to that frequency.
Energy Quanta Density Field: Described by \rho(\nu,x,t), this represents the number density of energons per unit volume and per unit frequency. The emergence of forces and interactions is determined by the gradient and time evolution of this density field.

Based on these elements, EQT proposes two fundamental propositions:

1.  Proposition on the Nature of Force: Force is not an independent exchange mediator, but a dynamic manifestation expressed during the process of the energy quanta density field tending toward equilibrium (or, more generally, energy minimization). Mathematically, this can be expressed as the force density f(x,t) \propto -\nabla\rho(x,t).
2.  Proposition on Mass Generation: The masson is a stationary state formed by the frequency condensation of high-frequency energons under non-linear coupling and feedback. This process requires certain critical density and coupling strength conditions.

This represents a "Phenomenon-Mechanism-Mathematics" Trinity construction method: starting from observed phenomena (e.g., decay, aggregation, radiation), proposing the energon as an operational mechanism, and then mathematically formalizing the mechanism using density gradients and frequency dynamics equations.

Relationship with Traditional Concepts

EQT does not simply discard existing concepts but offers a more fundamental interpretation of the "particle-field" dichotomy:

Standard Model Bosons: Gluons, W/Z bosons, and photons can still be understood as collections of energons within specific frequency bands or as specific excited modes. However, they are no longer considered the fundamental "existents," but rather stable manifestations of energon aggregation and coupling in a particular frequency range.
Higgs Mechanism: The vacuum expectation value and spontaneous symmetry breaking of the Higgs field are reinterpreted in this framework as the macroscopic expression of a low-frequency condensation in the frequency spectrum. This perspective emphasizes the "dynamical conditions of condensation" rather than merely treating the breaking as a mathematical structure.
Gravity and Dark Energy: Macroscopic phenomena like gravity and dark energy are viewed as the collective effect of the extremely low-frequency energon density field. Their "geometric" description (e.g., General Relativity) remains a valid macroscopic approximation, but the microscopic mechanism is explained by frequency flow and density gradients.

In summary, the "Energy Quantum" is not a heretical concept fundamentally opposed to current theories, but an attempt to establish a direct physical causal chain between the "phenomena" and the "mathematical structures" within existing theories.
